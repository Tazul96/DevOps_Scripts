Explanation of Fields
Numeric: The numeric value of the permission (e.g., 0755).
Symbolic: The symbolic representation (e.g., rwx r-x r-x).
Owner: Permissions for the owner of the file.
Group: Permissions for the group associated with the file.
Others: Permissions for everyone else (all other users).
Understanding the Numeric Values
Each permission is represented by a number:

Read (r) = 4
Write (w) = 2
Execute (x) = 1
You combine the numbers to form a 3-digit number for the owner, group, and others:

0 = No permissions
1 = Execute only
2 = Write only
3 = Write + Execute
4 = Read only
5 = Read + Execute
6 = Read + Write
7 = Read + Write + Execute
